#[Project 1: Loan Prediction Model]https://wlivinston.github.io/senyodatanalyticsportfolio/
This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a loan eligibility prediction model, using machine learning for a loan dataset.
* Data was taken from the Analytical Vidhya dataset
* Using Data Munging techniques in pandas to work with checking and filling missing values
* Dealth with How to analyse categorical variables
* Treating of extreme values and understand why they should not be treated as outliers by using log transformation to nullify their effect.
* The model Logistic Regression for prediction
* Algorithms Used :  Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Singular Value Decomposition
